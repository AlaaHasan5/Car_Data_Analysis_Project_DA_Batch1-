# Car_Data_Analysis_Project_DA_Batch1-

# Intro:
we made this project  as apart of training Data analysis using python  in Aiapproach club.

# Objective
The aim is to identify the interplay between different information related to cars

# About the dataset
The dataset is about car and it contain the next information
1- Make: The brand or manufacturer of the car, such as Toyota or Ford.
2- Model: The specific model of the car, such as Corolla or Mustang.
3- Type: The body style of the car, such as sedan, coupe, or SUV.
4- Origin: The country or region where the car was manufactured or assembled.
5- DriveTrain: The type of drivetrain that the car has, such as front-wheel drive, rear-wheel drive, or all-wheel drive.
6- MSRP: The Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price, which is the price suggested by the car manufacturer for the car when it is sold new.
7- Invoice: The invoice price of the car, which is the price that the dealer pays the manufacturer for the car.
8- EngineSize: The displacement of the engine, typically measured in liters or cubic centimeters (cc).
9- Cylinders: The number of cylinders in the engine, which can be used to determine the power and fuel efficiency of the car.
10- Horsepower: The maximum power output of the car's engine, typically measured in horsepower (hp).
11- MPG_City: The estimated fuel efficiency of the car in miles per gallon (mpg) when driven in city conditions.
12- MPG_Highway: The estimated fuel efficiency of the car in miles per gallon (mpg) when driven on the highway.
13- Weight: The weight of the car in pounds (lbs), which can affect its handling, fuel efficiency, and acceleration.
14- Wheelbase: The distance between the centers of the front and rear wheels of the car, typically measured in inches.
15- Length: The length of the car from the front bumper to the rear bumper, typically measured in inches.

# Steps :
1- import module
2- read dataset file
3- clean data
4- visualiz data

# Conclusion of project:
1- The greater the weight, the greater the engine capacity
2- Prices are high in Europe, but they are close in America and Asia, with a slight increase in America
3- We note that the highest-priced cars are (Porsche) cars, while the lowest are (Scion) cars. We also note that there is a large discrepancy in the prices of cars.
4- We note that an increase in engine capacity leads to a slight increase in the price
5- There is no relationship between the type of propulsion and the engine capacity
6- We note that sports cars are the highest in price, while hybrid cars are the lowest in price, while the prices of the rest of the cars are similar.
7- Hybrid cars consume the most fuel, while off-road vehicles consume the least
8- The difference in consumption between cities and highways is small for hybrid cars, while the difference in other types is greater
